# 128 Header Pin Extension 

Hey,
I am currently creating my own sim tool for MSFS 20/24.
For this I needed at least 60 pin for all switch, so instead of buying 10 arduino I thinked about it and thought it would be useful to create a pcb that can upgrade my arduino UNO from 13 port to 141
.

For the prices here's the details.
- The pcb itself is $2
- The components are $57.80
- The assembly is $28.22
- The delivery is $17.37 (cheapest choice available)
- The total is **$95.39** (I have a $10 coupon - The real price is $105.39)

I had never used this app so kinda complicated to start but once I got a bit used to, it got quite easy and I used 2 plugins that saved my life for the routing (more than 150 route lol)
